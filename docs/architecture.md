# System Architecture

The application consists of two components:

1. **Backend** - Node.js with Express for REST APIs to manage tasks, notes, invoices, and users.
2. **Frontend** - React-based interface similar in style to the Airbnb host dashboard.

The backend exposes endpoints for CRUD operations while the frontend consumes these endpoints and provides a minimal UI for staff members.
